# SillyTavern-AnotherTagManager

## DISCLAIMER
* I'm not a dev, so yeah my code is not perfect (particularly the CSS, hate this one),
* This extension has not been tested on mobile, so expect the UI to not be usable on it. I don't intend to work on this, because i'm really bad at handling UI.

## What is this extension doing?

SillyTavern ATM is an extension which provides a quick and easy way to edits tags cards.

I've decided to work on it to have something that better fits my needs because I have way too many characters and most of them are not/bad tagged.

* With ATM, you can order by the number of tags characters have, to look for the ones without tags for example.
* Editing tags on a character doesn't load its chat, so it doesn't modify your recent history.

## Prerequisites

This extension has been tested on SillyTavern 1.11.0 and 1.11.1.

## Installation

Utilize SillyTavern's third party extension importer to install like any other extension.

## Usage

The extension will add a new tag button just before the Group Button.

A click on this button will open a popup, displaying your characters with the number of tags it actually have.

You have the possibility to sort alphabetically or by the number of tags.

When choosing a character, the bottom part will display basic information about the character, including his tags and description (read-only).

You can now add, remove or create tags like you normally do with the classical interface.
