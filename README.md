# SillyTavern-AnotherTagManager

## DISCLAIMER
* I'm not a developer, so yes, my code is not perfect (especially the CSS, I hate that).
* This extension has not been tested on mobile phones, so expect the UI to be unusable on them. I don't intend to work on it, because I'm really bad with UI.

## What is this extension doing?

SillyTavern ATM is an extension which provides a quick and easy way to edits tags cards.

I've decided to work on it to have something that better suits my needs, because I have way too many characters and most of them are not/poorly tagged.

* With ATM, you can sort by the number of tags characters have, for example, to find those without tags.
* Editing tags on a character does not load their chat, so it won't change the chat recent history.

## Prerequisites

This extension has been tested on SillyTavern 1.11.0 and 1.11.1.

## Installation

Utilize SillyTavern's third party extension importer to install like any other extension.

## Usage

The extension will add a new Tag button just before the Group button.

Clicking on this button will open a pop-up window showing your characters and the number of tags they currently have.

You can sort alphabetically or by number of tags.
You also have access to a search bar.

When you select a character, basic information about the character is displayed at the bottom, including its tags and description (read-only).

You can now add, remove or create tags as you would in the classic interface.
